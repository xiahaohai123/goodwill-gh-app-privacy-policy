    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the internal management application (the "App") developed and operated by <strong>WANGKANG GHANA LIMITED</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). This App is strictly for internal corporate use by our authorized employees and staff.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>As an internal HR and attendance management tool, the App processes the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Employment Information:</strong> Basic employee profiles, employee IDs, and HR-related records provisioned by our administrative team.</li>
        <li><strong>Attendance Data:</strong> Clock-in/clock-out times and related offline attendance records.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Data (Camera/Storage):</strong> The App may require access to your device's camera strictly for scanning QR codes related to attendance or equipment verification. It also utilizes local storage to support the offline-first attendance synchronization feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>All data processed by the App is used exclusively for internal business operations, including but not limited to payroll processing, HR management, and factory operational efficiency. We do not use this data for any marketing or commercial profiling purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not</strong> sell, rent, or share any employee data collected through this App with third parties. Data is only accessible to authorized HR personnel and system administrators within WANGKANG GHANA LIMITED.</p>

    <h2>4. Account Deletion and Management</h2>
    <p>Because this is a strictly internal corporate tool, user accounts are centrally managed by our HR department. Employees cannot unilaterally delete their employment profiles or attendance records from within the App. If an employee's contract is terminated, the HR department will securely deactivate and process their data in accordance with local labor laws and company policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact the WANGKANG GHANA LIMITED Human Resources or IT department directly.</p>
